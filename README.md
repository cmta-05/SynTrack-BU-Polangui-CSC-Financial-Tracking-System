# 📁 CSC Financial Tracking and Payment Management System

### **Official Repository – BSIT 3B Group 3**

Welcome to the main repository for our SIA project:
**CSC Financial Tracking and Payment Management System**
(Client: *Bicol University Polangui – College Student Council*)

This repo stores **all project files**, arranged per phase and per step.
Every member must follow the instructions below when uploading or updating files.

# 📘 1. Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:

* A **safe and organized storage** for all project documents
* A **version-controlled workspace** so nothing gets overwritten
* A **central reference** for our outputs per Phase (1–3)

Unlike Google Drive, files here **do not auto-convert** (e.g., Word → Google Docs), and
formatting stays clean and consistent.

# 📥 3. How to Upload Files (Simple Walkthrough)

### **A. Prepare the file**

1. Save the file on your laptop with a clear filename.
2. Remove personal notes or temporary comments inside the document.
3. Make sure the file is one of the accepted formats:

   * `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.pdf`, `.zip`

---

### **B. Upload the file to GitHub**

1. Open the repository.
2. Locate the correct folder (ex: `Phase_1_Requirements_and_Specification/Step_2_Organization`).
3. Click **Add file → Upload files**.
4. Drag the file OR click “choose your files” to select it.
5. Scroll down to the commit box and enter the commit message using the required format.
6. Click **Commit changes**.

---

### **C. Updating an existing file**

* To update: re-upload the file **with the same filename** to replace it.
* Use an **UPDATE** commit message.
* For big revisions, inform Charlene first.

---

# 🧾 4. Commit Message Format (Required)

Every commit must follow this format:

```
[PhaseX][StepY] ACTION: short description | Initials
```

### **Examples**

```
[Phase1][Step1] ADD: JAD Results final version | HB
[Phase1][Step2] UPDATE: ReqMatrix columns added | KA
[Phase1][Step5] ADD: RDR draft v1 | CM
```

### **Allowed ACTION words**

* `ADD`
* `UPDATE`
* `REPLACE`
* `REMOVE`

---

# 🗂️ 5. Filename Rules

Use clear filenames so everyone understands the content quickly.

Recommended pattern:

```
FileDescription_v1_Initials.ext
```

Examples:

* `ReqMatrix_v1_KA.xlsx`
* `ElicitationSummary_v1_HB.docx`
* `RDR_Draft_v1_CM.docx`

If a file is already standardized (e.g., `JADResults_CSC_Group3.docx`), you may keep it.

---

# 🔄 6. Fixing Mistakes

If the wrong file was uploaded:

* Go to the file → click **History** → find the old version → use **Revert**
  or
* Notify Charlene to fix it

Do not upload multiple versions trying to correct your mistake — ask first.

If you want, I can also generate a **matching CONTRIBUTING.md** or
create an actual **initial folder skeleton** text you can copy into GitHub.

Would you like that?
